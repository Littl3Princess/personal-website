This site is created for a storage purpose - the storage of knowledge. Besides the blog, I try to constantly improve & update my current knowledge about Finance through digging in various books & specialized forums. I hope, this will help to clarify my thoughts (that are subject to many biases) more clearly in normal environment 

And, yeah, I want to apply to Goldman Sachs.
